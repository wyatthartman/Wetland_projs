## SF Salinity OTU functions
16S rRNA data from SF Bay wetland metagenomes along a salinity gradient, these functions are actively under development.

Intended as a pipeline for passing OTU tables to complex plots.
R modules built for preprocessing and correlations
.ipynb files show development of complex plotting fucntions for barplots and heatmaps.

several additional files as data sources.

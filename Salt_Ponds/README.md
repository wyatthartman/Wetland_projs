## Salt Ponds: Microbial metagenomes and methane
Microbes and CH4 fluxes were measured in a series of historic, restored, and unrestored Salt Ponds in the SF Bay.

Files support preliminary analysis on 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenome data.
.ipynb files show:
- inspecting and plotting environment data (separately)
- testing for categorical and continuous predictors of CH4 (seperately)
- Shotgun metagenome data linked to CH4 and element cycling
- Testing of metagenome "bins" for traits linked to CH4 (LDA)

Many other files are supporting data.

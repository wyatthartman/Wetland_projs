# Timberlake soil salinity incubations

Wetland soils were exposed to 4 treatments, and incubated anaerobically:
- Control
+ Sulfate
+ Artificial Seawater (ASW)
+ ASW - Sulfate

Salinity treatments were + 5 ppt.

Data: 
16s rRNA (iTag OTUs)
Shotgun metagenomes (KOs)

Basic notebooks show treatement testing effects and plots using DESeq2.
Notebooks were early and could use refinement, function updates.
